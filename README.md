# Real Estate Rental Calculator

## Software Summary

I'm building a calculator, only using Python, that calculates the initial capital investment and ROI for a residential rental property.

## Built With

* Python 3.11

## Version History

**Version 0.1**  
*8/10/2023*  
* This app is not complete yet; still in development, so no Version 1.0 at this time.

**Version 0.2**  
*8/23/2023*  
* Initial capital, monthly income, and monthly expenses can now be calculated.
* Will need to refine these functions (like allowing only percentages or a certain amount of decimal places to be input into the entries).
* Decided on using a .grid() layout rather than a .pack() one.
